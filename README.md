# Module 2

This assignment was to build and start a portfolio page to eventually showcase skills and applications for future jobs.

## Description

- Header with working UI 
- Added a png tune that will eventually change to a signiture
- Added headshot with name and title
- all links work as planned. I have not added actual emails as to avoid spam.
- Projects section did not come out as planned. I would like them to be in a horizontal row, and when moused over they expand.
- links to projects work, but have no destination due to no applications or projects currently.
- Website is responsive, but would need more work to be mobile friendly.
